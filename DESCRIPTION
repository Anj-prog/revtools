Title: Tools to Support Evidence Synthesis

Description: Researchers commonly need to summarize scientific information, a process known as 'evidence synthesis'. The first stage of a synthesis process (such as a systematic review or meta-analysis) is to download a list of references from academic search engines such as 'Web of Knowledge' or 'Scopus'. This information can be sorted manually (the traditional approach to systematic review), or the user can draw on tools from machine learning to help them visualise patterns in the corpus. 'revtools' uses topic models to render ordinations of text drawn from article titles, keywords and abstracts, and allows the user to interactively select or exclude individual references, words or topics. 'revtools' does not currently provide tools for analysis of data drawn from those references, features that are available in other packages such as 'metagear' or 'metafor'.
